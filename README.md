So, Hii everyone, My self Ashish Joshi and I am persuing Computer science degree with specialisation in Artifical Intelligence as an undergrad from NSUT(Dwarka)
So, this repository contains my jupyter files which I write to track my ML journey progress, its similar to the notebooks of 100days of machine learning by campus X (I am rn studying from him and stanford lectures) so yeah It contains codes for machine learning algorithms written by me.
So yeah, thats all from my side, I hope you guys have a great day, signing off...
